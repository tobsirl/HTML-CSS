/* DON'T TOUCH THIS! */

/* Your goal is to turn basic HTML into a responsive, functional navbar, which includes both arranging the items and styling them. The navbar must stretch across the whole page & have a background color set. The items must be arranged horizontally & be placed below the title, which is centered in the middle of the navbar. Good luck! */

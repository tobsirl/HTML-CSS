        <img src="//unsplash.it/200/200" alt="" /> Hello there! Come here my
        little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What
        happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're
        still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The
        Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what
        brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching
        for his former master...You must learn the ways of the Force if you're
        to come with me to Alderaan. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've
        got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I need your help,
        Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I
        can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the
        Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's
        such a long way from here. That's your uncle talking. Oh, God, my uncle.
        How am I ever going to explain this?I've never seen such devotion in a
        droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the
        property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know
        who he's talking about?
